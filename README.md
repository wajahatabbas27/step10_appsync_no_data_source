## No data Source

we are using no data source here as we are having a schema here in the appsync and generating the api ,
moreover we are handling the request in the request-Mapping-template and using it all the way

In this way we donot need any servive like dynamoDB to save the data and lambda function to generate the logic but here we are just using the Appsync resolver to handle and to put the logic into it.
